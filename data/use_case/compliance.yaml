                  In this steps you'll create deployments that
                  1. Create an MdaiHub
                  1. Create an OpenTelemetry collector
                  1. Create a synthetic log stream that forwards data to your collector

                  Run the following command an you'll see these resources created.

                  ```
                  mdai use-case compliance --version 0.8.6
                  ```

                  If you haven't yet logged into Grafana, the login is `admin` / `mdai`
                body: |
                  ```
                  kubectl port-forward -n mdai svc/mdai-grafana 3000:80
                  ```

                  Navigate to the [OTel Dataflow Dashboard](http://localhost:3000/d/otel_view/otel-data-flow?orgId=1&from=now-15m&to=now&refresh=5s)

                  ![Grafana](../../../../images/compliance/step_1.png)

                  You should see a consistent stream of data and a 1:1 ratio of logs received : logs exported

                  Update your collector to utilize static routing. We've prepared a file for you, `0.8.6/use_cases/compliance/otel_static.yaml`

              Update your collector to utilize static routing. We've prepared a file for you, `0.8.6/use_cases/compliance/otel_static.yaml`

            body: |
              You should see that your log stream no longer sends the 1:1 ratio and has decreased the amount exported.
