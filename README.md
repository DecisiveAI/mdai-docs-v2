# MyDecisive Documentation

This is the source repository for the MyDecisive documentation.

## Building the MyDecisive Documentation

The MyDecisive documentation is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator.

### Get Started

The quick way to get started:

1. Close this repository.
2. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) (extended edition).
3. Test changes locally by building and loading the site locally with Hugo. (`hugo server -D`)
4. Create a PR to get your changes reviewed before they're merged.

Your environment must have Git before you can get going. Depending on what you intend to do (beyond just documentation and plain CSS), the Hugo documentation has more information on other resources you may need.
