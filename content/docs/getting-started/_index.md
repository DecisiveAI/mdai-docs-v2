MyDecisive solutions transform OTel from a static configuration challenge into an intelligent, self-managing platform. Solutions run on infrastructure called the MDAI cluster. The MDAI cluster includes both industry-standard components and the MDAI hub.

You can set up the MDAI cluster and test drive MyDecisive observability solutions on your laptop. Even with a local install, you‚Äôll be able to demonstrate the ease and power of the MDAI cluster and try out different solutions. Alternatively, you can install the MDAI cluster on AWS to more closely simulate a production environment and use your own data.

Once you complete the installation, use the provided recipes to install and test MyDecisive solutions.
