MyDecisive solutions transform OpenTelemetry from a static configuration challenge into an intelligent, self-managing platform. These solutions run on our infrastructure, the MdaiHub, which utilizes industry-standard and proprietary open-source components.

You can set up and test drive MyDecisive observability solutions easily:

1. Locally: Install the MDAI cluster on your laptop to demonstrate its ease and power and try out different solutions.

1. AWS (coming soon): Install the MDAI cluster on AWS to simulate a production environment and use your own data.

Once installed, you can use the MyDecisive recipes to configure, install, and test MyDecisive solutions.
