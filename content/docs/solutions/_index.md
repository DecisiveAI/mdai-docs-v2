      <strong>The challenge:</strong>
      <p>
      Sending vendors too much data, data of questionable value, or insufficient data to work with in their tools.
      </p>
      <strong>The solution:</strong>
      <p>
      MyDecisive’s Runtime Data Filtration provides fine-grained per-source filtration rules that are dynamic. You can change filtering behavior by time of day, data volume, values in the signal, and more… all without ever having to manually configure these capabilities.

      <strong>The challenge:</strong>
      <p>
      Your teams can do all the development necessary to unlock the power of distributed tracing data in your applications and services, but vendors down-sample your trace data and the right traces never seem to be available in their products. What if you could scalably set production watchpoints that alert you to traces that match certain patterns.
      </p>
      <strong>The solution:</strong>
      <p>
      Runtime Trace Triggers scale to thousands of simultaneous production trigger rules in our product. The rules can be updated through tools and automation and do not require a restart of your services in order to set or unset watchpoints. Get started now hearing about (and paying for) just the trace data you want, delivered to your developers’ tool of choice.
