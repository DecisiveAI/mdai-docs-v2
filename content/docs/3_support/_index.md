{{% details title="What is the MyDecisive platform and how does it work?" closed="true" %}}

MyDecisive.ai (MDAI) built its platform, the Smart Telemetry Hub, on Open Telemetry, and is deployed on your Kubernetes cluster. It is designed to work with your existing observability tools to transform passive monitoring to an automated platform.

The Smart Telemetry Hub empowers you to dynamically configure data collection and utilization within your cloud, delivering automated workflows and actions based on real-time data and thresholds. As a result, you don’t need to rely on passive dashboards and canned queries, instead, you gain an intelligent, automated platform that provides real-time insights of your entire IT infrastructure and actionable workflows that optimize applications and services.

Much like Cisco transformed network management, MyDecisive is revolutionizing observability with a dynamic, automated, and intelligent software-driven approach that transforms passive monitoring into intelligent automation.

{{% details title="What advantages does MyDecisive offer compared to traditional observability solutions?" closed="true" %}}

The Smart Telemetry Hub empowers IT teams to transform their observability tools from passive monitoring to an action-oriented automated platform. Its advantages over traditional observability solutions include:

**Reduced Vendor Lock-in**:
MyDecisive uses OpenTelemetry and other open-source technologies including Kubernetes and Prometheus to ingest, process, and expose data to your existing observability tools, thus improving interoperability and reducing dependency on any single vendor.

**Simplified OpenTelemetry Management**:
OpenTelemetry has a diverse set of configuration options across various components, making the management and maintenance of multiple pipelines complex. MyDecisive’s Smart Telemetry Hub provides a **centralized platform to easily make changes, updates, and deployments dynamically, without the need for re-deployments or downtime. The result**: teams improve productivity and reduce operational complexity, enabling them to focus on strategic initiatives.

**Safe and Transparent Data Filtration**:
Traditional observability vendors often charge for data ingested into their cloud, forcing organizations to compromise between data richness and insights to stay on budget. MyDecisive’s programmable Smart Telemetry Hub allows you to filter data safely, maintain a data backfill, and optimize system performance while controlling costs. When issues arise, you’ll have full telemetry available to replay and display on your monitoring system.

**Automation Platform**:
Managing OpenTelemetry-based pipelines typically requires manual effort, such as updating YAML files and restarting servers, leading to planned downtimes. MyDecisive’s Smart Telemetry Hub enables engineers to programmatically process and filter data, centrally manage and control telemetry pipelines, as well as update and deploy services and applications with minimal human intervention and zero downtime. This reduces operational complexity and frees up IT teams to focus on building innovative solutions.

{{% details title="How does MyDecisive and the Smart Telemetry Hub add value to my existing data management processes?" closed="true" %}}

Current data management processes involve proprietary technologies and numerous manual processes to get desired results. MyDecisive uses open-source software and a programmable platform to provide flexibility, automation, and additional intelligence. As a result, manual processes are reduced and real-time insights are delivered.
