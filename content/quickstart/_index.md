> MDAI is intended for devops engineers and leaders who want to take control of their telemetry and budgets. If you’re searching for composable observability, less dependence on vendors, and more automated and intelligent solutions to visibility and analysis, MDAI is for you.

***[TODO] intro, list of steps for context, visual aid that changes per page.
??? Is it a linear process *?**??

Quickly set up the MDAI cluster and test drive Mydecisive observability solutions.

You'll need to install a number of dependencies to run the MDAI cluster. You’ll also need a GitHub accont to clone the MDAI repository. Once the MDAI cluster is running, continue to the use-case examples.
