As they run, services generate log data to provide visibility into what's happening. Log data can include anything from benign informational messages to full-blown errors. You want to know about errors, but too many informational messages can become distracting noise.

You'll be able to use MDAI to filter out unnecessary log lines. First, lets set up the log generators and generate log data. 

## Get the Configuration Files

In our Configs repo's [synthetics](https://github.com/DecisiveAI/configs/tree/main/synthetics) directory are synthetic log generators in the form of configuration files. You'll use these to generate synthetic log data.

Copy the following files into your working directory:

- loggen_services.yaml
- loggen_service_xtra_noisy.yaml
- loggen_service_noisy.yaml
- loggen_fluent_config.yaml

## Deploy Log Generators to Your Cluster

Let's create 3 different log generators.

The first emits logs for random services named `service####`, where `####` is a random number.

```
kubectl apply -f ./loggen_services.yaml
```

The second is a noisy log generator for a particular service (`service1234` by default).

```
kubectl apply -f ./loggen_service_noisy.yaml
```

The third is an excessively noisy version of the second log generator, but for a different service (`service4321` by default).

```
kubectl apply -f ./loggen_service_xtra_noisy.yaml
```

## Verify That Logs Are Being Generated

If the log generators are running, get the pods.

```
kubectl get pods -n mdai -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=mdai-log-generator
```

You should see a list of pods similar to the following.

```
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mdai-logger-d8bb6f897-f6jt6           1/1     Running   0          101s
mdai-logger-d8bb6f897-tzh6f           1/1     Running   0          101s
mdai-logger-d8bb6f897-w7d4n           1/1     Running   0          101s
mdai-logger-noisy-77fcbf8b9f-g4c9c    1/1     Running   0          84s
mdai-logger-noisy-77fcbf8b9f-tsg2s    1/1     Running   0          84s
mdai-logger-noisy-77fcbf8b9f-xrp8s    1/1     Running   0          84s
mdai-logger-xnoisy-686cb6465f-cdpvm   1/1     Running   0          71s
mdai-logger-xnoisy-686cb6465f-tdjkd   1/1     Running   0          71s
mdai-logger-xnoisy-686cb6465f-xdzvp   1/1     Running   0          71s
```

Verify that logs are being generated by using the `kubectl logs` command with any one of the pods.

```
kubectl logs -n mdai {pod name}
```

For example, the logs from the pod named `mdai-logger-xnoisy-686cb6465f-xdzvp` should contain a variety of log levels.

> [!TIP]
> If you installed K9s, you can use it to observe the logs. To launch the K9s application, enter `k9s` in the terminal window where you launched the cluster (for the correct context). Use the arrow keys to select one of the log generators, then press **l** (lowercase letter l). Press ESC to exit the log window.


## Success

Now that logs are being generated, we can [create a collector](collect.html).
