As they run, services generate log data to provide visibility into what's happening. Log data can include anything from benign informational messages to full-blown errors. You want to know about errors, but too many informational messages can become distracting noise.

You'll be able to use MDAI to filter out unnecessary log lines. First lets set up log generators and a pipeline to collect the logs and display telemetry data.

## Generate Log Data

Let's create 3 different log generators. The first emits logs for random services named `service####`, where `####` is a random number.

```
kubectl apply -f ./example_log_generator.yaml
```

The second is a noisy log generator for a particular service (`service1234` by default).

```
kubectl apply -f ./example_log_generator_noisy_service.yaml
```

The third is an excessively noisy version of the second log generator, but for a different service (`service4321` by default).

```
kubectl apply -f ./example_log_generator_xtra_noisy_service.yaml
```

### Verify That Logs Are Being Generated

If the log generators are running, get the pods.

```
kubectl get pods -n mdai -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=mdai-log-generator
```

Verify that logs are being generated by using the `kubectl logs` command with any one of the pods.

```
kubectl logs -n mdai xtra-noisy-logz-54c7877c4f-5svx8
```

The logs from the pod named xtra-noisy-logz-54c7877c4f-5svx8 should contain a variety of log levels.

> [!TIP]
> You can instead use K9s for obverving the logs. To launch the K9s application, enter `k9s` in the terminal window where you launched the cluster (for the correct context). Use the arrow keys to select one of the log generators, then press **l** (lowercase letter l). Press ESC to the log window.
