## MYDECISIVE SOLUTIONS

### Challenges In Current Observability Solutions

Today’s observability solutions continue to fail in delivering all the insights that organizations require due to:

- Limited Interoperability: Proprietary agents and methods hinder seamless integration, leading to longer mean time to detection.
- Data Richness vs. Cost Trade-off: Volume-based pricing forces teams to sacrifice comprehensive visibility in order to manage costs making root-cause analysis challenging.
- Lack of Braided Context: Linking error logs to sampled-based tracing leaves critical gaps in application monitoring.

What’s more, traditional solutions have made IT organizations reliant on dashboards and reactive alerts relegating them to a passive and reactive stance. It's time for a change.

Introducing MyDecisive's Smart Telemetry Hub: Revolutionizing Observability

With MyDecisive's OpenTelemetry-based programmable Smart Telemetry Hub, IT teams are empowered to transform passive monitoring into an action-oriented and automated platform.

We've developed observability solutions that directly address the challenges associated with limited interoperability, lack of data richness and braided context as well as rising costs:

1. Dynamic Data Filtration
2. Dynamic Trace Triggers

These open-source based solutions not only improve infrastructure interoperability but also empower IT organizations to take a more proactive approach to observability, enabling them to:

- Control the data ingest volume on a per service basis, allowing a balance of optimized performance and reduced costs.
- Access complete and searchable trace data and link them to log data and spot anomalies quickly, improving mean time to resolution.

### Dynamic Data Filtration

MDAI’s Dynamic Data Filtration solution provides the ability to filter the data you need based on operational priorities and also have a backfill of all other data for replay on demand during an incident. Engineering teams set up parameters on specific services at particular times and establish quotas on data volume. For example, critical services receive more data during peak business hours while less critical components operate with reduced telemetry. MDAI provides the ability to use a local buffer—a temporary storage layer (e.g., an S3 bucket or similar) that holds all of your telemetry for a certain number of hours. When an incident occurs, the data can be replayed and visualized through your existing observability vendor. The replay mechanism is dynamically triggered through specific criteria. For example, you can program the data backfill to automatically replay when the error rate increases, or when latency spikes, or when other anomalies occur. The result, your teams gain a dynamic, intelligent, and automated platform that is responsive to real-time business conditions.

### Dynamic Trace Triggers

Capturing all trace data with zero sampling and streamed to low-cost storage is at the heart of MDAI’s Dynamic Trace Triggers solution. MDAI’s Smart Telemetry Hub uses OpenTelemetry (OTel) to capture every span between all services. The Smart Telemetry Hub stores all span data in low-cost cloud storage and sends a subset to your current observability tools. At the same time, it maintains a set of business data that enables IT teams to further analyze what is normal during the course of business operations.

For example, ecommerce organizations that use the Smart Telemetry Hub allows them to store traces that track customer activities including the highest product searches. Dynamic Trace Triggers allow them to easily spot products that aren't getting attention based on the trace data. For healthcare providers, Dynamic Trace Triggers can flag unusual billing amounts or codes. As a result, teams can access the traces where these odd transactions happened, making it easy to investigate.

Unlike other systems that only look at a small sample of data, the Smart Telemetry Hub’s Dynamic Trace Triggers captures all traces and empowers teams to analyze everything. As a result, IT teams can spot unusual patterns or behaviors, alerting to potential issues in  business operations and automatically trigger workflows that enable teams to take action.

### What MyDecisive Delivers

With MyDecisive and the Smart Telemetry Hub, IT organizations can transform observability from passive monitoring to intelligent automation. Unlike traditional tools that rely on dashboards and reactive alerts, the Smart Telemetry Hub continuously interprets data, detects emerging patterns, and initiates proactive solutions - optimizing system performance, minimizing downtime, and reducing resolution times.

With MyDecisive’s Smart Telemetry Hub integrated into your telemetry pipeline, your organization adopts an action-oriented approach that not only optimizes system availability and operational responsiveness but also reduces costs to their lowest levels. This transformation empowers your IT organization to evolve from a reactive support function into a strategic driver of business value and agility.
