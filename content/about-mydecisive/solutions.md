## MYDECISIVE SOLUTIONS

### Challenges

Current observability solutions pose several challenges for organizations. They often require the installation of proprietary agents, which makes interoperability with other platforms nearly impossible. To make matters worse, many vendors price their solutions based on the volume of data ingested, resulting in teams compromising data richness to control observability costs. At the end of the day, even with sampled data ingests, IT organizations are still experiencing higher costs without getting the promised benefits.

Enter the MDAI Smart Telemetry Hub. This programmable platform empowers IT teams to maintain data richness while reducing costs using dynamic data filtration.

### Dynamic Data Filtration

MDAI’s Dynamic Data Filtration solution provides the ability to filter the data you need based on operational priorities and also have a backfill of all other data for replay on demand during an incident. Engineering teams set up parameters on specific services at particular times and establish quotas on data volume. For example, critical services receive more data during peak business hours while less critical components operate with reduced telemetry. MDAI provides the ability to use a local buffer—a temporary storage layer (e.g., an S3 bucket or similar) that holds all of your telemetry for a certain number of hours. When an incident occurs, the data can be replayed and visualized through your existing observability vendor. The replay mechanism is dynamically triggered through specific criteria. For example, you can program the data backfill to automatically replay when the error rate increases, or when latency spikes, or when other anomalies occur. The result, your teams gain a dynamic, intelligent, and automated platform that is responsive to real-time business conditions.

### What MyDecisive Delivers

With MyDecisive and the Smart Telemetry Hub, IT organizations can transform observability from passive monitoring to intelligent automation. Unlike traditional tools that rely on dashboards and reactive alerts, the Smart Telemetry Hub continuously interprets data, detects emerging patterns, and initiates proactive solutions - optimizing system performance, minimizing downtime, and reducing resolution times.

With MyDecisive’s Smart Telemetry Hub integrated into your telemetry pipeline, your organization adopts an action-oriented approach that not only optimizes system availability and operational responsiveness but also reduces costs to their lowest levels. This transformation empowers your IT organization to evolve from a reactive support function into a strategic driver of business value and agility.
