## MYDECISIVE SOLUTIONS

### Challenges

Current observability solutions pose several challenges for organizations. They often require the installation of proprietary agents, which makes interoperability with other platforms nearly impossible. Consequently, teams must make difficult decisions about what data to send, facing the dilemma of whether to transmit all their metrics, logs, traces, and events, only to discover their value during a crisis.

Additionally, the varying value and access frequency of log data over time can lead to inflated storage costs, compromising compliance and data retention policies. To make matters worse, many vendors price their solutions based on the volume of data ingested, resulting in higher costs without the expected benefits.

Enter the MDAI Smart Telemetry Hub. This innovative platform provides purpose-built and programmable configurations that deliver solutions to address the aforementioned data management challenges. With its Dynamic Data Filtration solution, unwanted data is filtered before it leaves your cloud ensuring only relevant logs, metrics, traces and events are ingested. Additionally, MDAI’s Dynamic Log Tiering solution enables you to decide where your critical data goes and how long it needs to be accessible. Furthermore, MDAI enables enterprises to customize their OTel observers (also known as “watchers”) to provide real-time insights into key metrics.

With MDAI, enterprises take full control of their data pipelines, leading to better predictability, more efficient data management, and lower overall costs.

### Dynamic Data Filtration

With MyDecisive’s Dynamic Data Filtration solution teams can choose exactly what data to ingest based on specific rules that are specified in the MDAI configuration file. DevOps teams can set up parameters to collect data from specific services at particular times and establish limits on data volume. Once these limits are reached, an event is triggered and actions are automatically taken. MDAI then dynamically updates its configuration, recompiles, and automatically deploys a new instance of the OTel collector—all without any downtime or manual effort.

### Dynamic Log Tiering

MyDecisive’s Dynamic Log Tiering solution gives DevOps teams the flexibility to send different logs to specific destinations or send the same logs to multiple places, all while applying different retention and security policies. By adjusting the parameters in MDAI’s configuration file, teams can dynamically modify various control points in their data pipeline. Users can choose their preferred storage providers, decide how many tiers they need, and set the rules governing log retention at each layer, creating a logging strategy that meets the specific needs of the organization.

### What MyDecisive Delivers

With MDAI’s dynamic, automated and intelligent platform, DevOps teams gain full control over their telemetry data empowering them to build observability pipelines that deliver real business value. Say goodbye to the days of sending all your data to a proprietary observability provider without knowing what value you’ll actually get in return. Thanks to MDAI’s software-driven OTel-based platform, teams can implement workflows that are both dynamic and automatic, reducing the need for manual intervention. Plus, MDAI continuously learns about your data, providing real-time insights on your services and infrastructure. The result: enhanced predictability in resource allocation, improved efficiency in data management, and lower overall costs.
