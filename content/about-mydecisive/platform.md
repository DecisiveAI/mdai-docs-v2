## MYDECISIVE PLATFORM OVERVIEW

Much like Cisco revolutionized network management and automation through technology-driven solutions, MyDecisive.ai (MDAI) is pioneering observability programmability with a software-driven, open-source platform. The MDAI Smart Telemetry Hub simplifies OpenTelmetry (OTel), delivers safe and transparent data filtration, and provides intelligent automation for real-time adaptability.

MDAI works seamlessly with your current observability tools as well as your existing infrastructure - including AWS. The MDAI Smart Telemetry Hub is deployed in your Kubernetes (k8s) cluster and using OpenTelemetry Collector (contrib distribution) as the foundation, collects data from your critical applications and infrastructure.

The programmable Smart Telemetry Hub is powered by OTel-based observers and dynamic variables which are configuration parameters that adapt based on real-time data streams. Dynamic variable values mapped to services, incorporates logic that can automatically trigger specific outcomes such as data filtration and enrichment, intelligent security policies and cost optimization.

With MDAI integrated into your telemetry pipeline, you can:

- **Simplify OpenTelemetry management and boost productivity**
  MDAI's Smart Telemetry Hub streamlines OpenTelemetry-based pipeline management empowering you to centrally manage and control system health in real-time as well as make dynamic adjustment and re-deployments with minimal human intervention and zero downtime.
- **Take control of telemetry costs without sacrificing data richness**
  The programmable Smart Telemetry Hub, enables you to filter data safely and maintain a data backfill. When issues arise, youâ€™ll have all your full telemetry available to replay and display on your monitoring system. The result: improved visibility, optimized system performance and controlled costs.
- **Transform passive monitoring to full automation**
  With the programmable Smart Telemetry Hub, you can automate observability workflows and create specific outcomes based on real-time data conditions. This is done with minimal human intervention and zero downtime, enabling your engineers to focus on strategic initiatives and drive business growth.

With MyDecisive integrated into your telemetry pipeline, your organization adopts an action-oriented approach that not only optimizes system availability and operational responsiveness but also reduces costs to their lowest levels. As a result, your IT organization elevates from a reactive support function to a strategic driver of business value and agility.
