## MYDECISIVE PLATFORM OVERVIEW

Much like Cisco revolutionized network management and automation through technology-driven solutions, MyDecisive.ai (MDAI) is pioneering observability programmability with a software-driven, open-source platform that is dynamic, automated, and intelligent.

- Dynamic: Variable-based parameters enable dynamic changes so you can redeploy new configurations as data streams evolve.
- Automated: Actions are automatically triggered based on dynamic thresholds and parameters.
- Intelligent: Continuous observation of telemetry data delivers real-time insights about service importance, giving you full control over allocating resources.

MDAI works seamlessly with your current observability tools as well as your existing infrastructure - including AWS - enabling predictability, data management efficiency and control while reducing overall costs.

The MDAI Smart Telemetry Hub (MDAI Hub) is deployed in your Kubernetes (k8s) cluster and using OpenTelemetry Collector (contrib distribution) as the foundation, collects data from your critical applications and infrastructure. The MDAI Hub is powered by configurations that include variable-based parameters and OTel-based observers that provide dynamic data filtration and log tiering. These MDAI-developed workflows use dynamic variable values mapped to services, incorporating logic that can trigger specific outcomes. Once criteria or thresholds are met, the MDAI Smart Telemetry Hub automatically updates and deploys new configurationsâ€”no downtime or manual intervention needed!
