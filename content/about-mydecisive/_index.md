## Company Overview

### Our Vision

At MyDecisive, we believe that observability needs to evolve beyond passive monitoring to intelligent automation. Currently, observability practices are mostly reactive with teams relying on alerts, logs and dashboards that require manual queries to identify root causes. Moreover, traditional observability platforms require proprietary software that make interoperability with other systems challenging. This proprietary nature, coupled with vendors' pricing models based on data ingestion volume, creates a significant dilemma for IT organizations. Teams are forced to make a difficult trade-off between data richness and cost-effectiveness, often leading to compromised insights and delayed mean-time-to-resolution. The passive nature of current observability practices, combined with low return on investments, underscores the need for a more proactive and intelligent approach to observability.

To address these challenges, we’ve developed an innovative approach. We are focusing on the concept of "Potentials and Actions" —- being ready to take meaningful automated actions with the right data, at the right place, at the right time. To achieve this, we built a platform founded on OpenTelemetry (OTel) and extended it with dynamic capabilities that traditional methods lack. While standard OTel requires static configurations and manual management, our Smart Telemetry Hub introduces centralized management, dynamic data filtration, intelligent automation, and real-time adaptability.

With this innovative approach, our goal is to fundamentally change how organizations think about observability—moving from reactive monitoring to proactive system optimization. By empowering IT teams to automate and adapt their infrastructure in real-time, we enable organizations to significantly reduce downtime, optimize resources, and drive operational excellence. This approach not only resolves the limitations of traditional systems but also provides a more efficient and cost-effective platform for understanding system health in real-time and taking immediate action.

### History and Thought Leadership
