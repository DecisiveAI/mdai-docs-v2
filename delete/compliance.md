#### Use case

Guarantee regulatory compliance by forking every telemetry stream—no matter where the data is routed, filtered, or sampled—and persisting a full, unmodified copy into long-term cold or glacial storage for audit and retention needs.

#### Prerequisites

1. Long-term storage backend (cold/glacial tiers)
1. Fork/tee in pipeline
1. Policy/config to duplicate all streams
1. IAM & encryption keys
